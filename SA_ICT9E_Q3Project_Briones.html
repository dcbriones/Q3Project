          <td class="text-light">It's a good idea to store any and all flammable materials in safe and secure places away from anything that could set them ablaze. They should also not be all stored in one area of the house to avoid all of them bursting into flame at the same time. Another thing to keep in mind is to keep both flammable materials and firestarters in locations where a child cannot easily access them so that they do not accidentally injure themselves or ignite or consume the chemicals.</td>
